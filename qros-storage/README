# qros-storage
This is a convergent repository for various qr code data storage projects with the goal of creating a single qr code storage solution.

The following will gzip, base64 encode, split into chunks, write all data to the 'chunks.json' file, create qr codes and a qr code video file for the 'Virtual_Forest_Epoch_Rising.txt' file.

...
python3 qros-builder-full
...

Please note there is a 'chunks.json' example located here:

https://github.com/txtatech/qros-storage/blob/main/qros-storage/example_outputs/chunks.json

The following will read the .png qr codes and create ASCII art qr codes:

...
bash qr-png-ascii-convert.sh
...

The final bash script will concatenate the individual ASCII art qr codes into a single text file and add the required padding:

...
bash ablob-padding.sh
...
